# Commit
The command `git commit` will take all tracked changes (items added with [git add](./Add.md) and package them up in what is called a commit.
Commits come with with commit messages that are required for each commit. You add a message to a commit command by using the `-m` flag followed by a message in quotes.
A commit message_can_be anything, but best practice dictates that you should use that message to indicate the changes included in the commit.

```
git add .
git commit -m "Added register functionality"
```
